# Marly, A new IoT scripting language

See https://github.com/cmarrin/m8rscript/wiki for an overview of m8rscript and its features.

Marly is a stack based RPN scripting language with some characteristics of [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) and [Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)).

I wrote Marly to see if I could make a small language for use on embedded systems like [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) that was still powerful.

Marly is a work in progress. See Marly.h for the syntax.
